I am currently pursuing my B.Tech from The LNM Institute Of Information And technology. I am currently a member of the CIPHER Tech Club at my college, where I actively participate in various technical and collaborative activities. Being a part of this club has provided me with valuable learning experiences, helping me enhance my technical skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. I enjoy turning ideas into reality through clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me working on my fitness and playing sports. Currently i am working on several projects based on real life applications.</h1>
